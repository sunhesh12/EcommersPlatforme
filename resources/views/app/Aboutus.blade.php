                    We always aim to please the home market, supplying great computers and hardware at great prices 
                    to non-corporate customers, through our large Melbourne CBD showroom and our online store.
                </p>

                    Shop management approach fosters a strong customer service focus in our staff. We prefer to cultivate 
                    long-term client relationships rather than achieve quick sales, demonstrated in the measure of our long-term success.
